# VisualVerse---Image-Captioning
Images are one of the most expressive forms of data, carrying
immense amounts of information. However, enabling machines to
interpret and describe images accurately is a complex challenge. This
project addresses that challenge by leveraging the power of deep
learning to classify images into meaningful categories and generate
descriptive captions. By combining computer vision and natural
language processing, the system bridges the gap between image
understanding and language generation.
